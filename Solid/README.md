# S.O.L.I.D Design pattern 

**S.O.L.I.D** is acronym for the **first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles** by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin).
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easy refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.    

Many nowadays popular PHP frameworks implement **S.O.L.I.D** design principle in their core.   

### S.O.L.I.D stands for:

1. **S** - [Single-responsibility principle](./SingleResponsibility) 
2. **O** - Open-closed principe 
3. **L** - Liskov substitution principle
4. **I** - Interface segregation principle
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion  principle
